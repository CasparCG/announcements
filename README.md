# Latest (2020-05-18)

Long time no see! During this time a lot have been worked on behind the scenes. We have been working on establishing processes around the project it-self, the future of the project and how to work with our community. I will try to cover as much as possible without writing a book.

### Announcements
#### CasparCG Server
* **[v2.3.0 LTS Beta 1 is released][1]** üöÄ  
It‚Äôs here, the first LTS version ever of CasparCG Server! Even if it is a beta release we have been all working hard to make this happen. As the name indicates we have been working and focusing on stability and reliability in this version. We have also done smaller improvements to the performance compared to the previous version.

* **LTS, yes, that's true** ‚òÑÔ∏è  
As a member of the community and user of CasparCG Server, you can from now on expect support from the community for two years from the release date for LTS-versions. CasparCG Server v2.3.0 LTS will be released during late Q2 this year. Focus on the LTS versions will be securing stability, performance and reliability. In between of the LTS releases more frequent releases will be done to a non LTS version that‚Äôs more feature rich.

#### The Project
* **Technical Steering Committee - TSC**   
To secure the processes and the future around the CasparCG project, a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) has been established. The layout of the TSC isn‚Äôt just finished yet is work in progress. All protocols and decisions made in the TSC will be available at GitHub in a repository named TSC. Currently we are a small group of members but will in the future invite more members when the layout of the TSC is decided.
(Inspiration from the [nodejs][2] project)

* **Announcements**
Will be done in a repository at GitHub called Announcements. The structure will be the same as for the TSC repository mentioned above and all announcements will be verified using GPG signing.

* **Public roadmap**  
A public roadmap will be published by the TSC when it‚Äôs done. Until then you can follow the progress at [GitHub Milestones][3].

* **CasparCG Client**  
I have seen questions about the official CasparCG Client popping up here and there and I hope this will give you some understanding where it‚Äôs heading. A new version of the CasparCG Client will be released to match the changes in CasparCG Server v2.3.0 LTS when the LTS is complete. There is not active development of the client as is today but the pull requests available will be merged.

#### Help Wanted
* **Documentation**  
The project is in need of help regarding two things, documentation of CasparCG Server and make it available at GitBook that has provided the CasparCG organisation with an open source plan
(thanks GitBook for supporting open source).

* **CasparCG Client**  
The community also needs help regarding the development of CasparCG Client.
Currently the project has no lead for CasparCG Client.
